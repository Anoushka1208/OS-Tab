# OS-Tab
We're developing a Multi-OS tablet using a Raspberry Pi and a pre-built electronics circuit. It features keyboard slots for coding and initially runs on a power supply, with plans for battery operation later. Our goal is to offer a more affordable, accessible alternative to existing products, making it economically viable for a wider audience.
